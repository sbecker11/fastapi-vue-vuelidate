# Developing a Single Page App with FastAPI and Vue.js and Vuetify

Adapted from Michael Herman's article [Developing a Single Page App with FastAPI and Vue.js](https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-fastapi-and-vuejs/)
last updated December 14th, 2022, with github repo [https://github.com/testdrivenio/fastapi-vue](https://github.com/testdrivenio/fastapi-vue).

Pay particular attention to the graphical OpenAPI interface, which is auto-generated by **FastAPI**!


I simply added Vuelidate validation rules, and a password verify text input field, to the existing registration page. See snapshot:

### Refer to the [original article](https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-fastapi-and-vuejs) for build instructions.


Build the images and spin up the containers:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

Apply the migrations:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec backend aerich upgrade
```


## Verify that the services are running  

Open browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)  

This should show "FastAPI service is running"

## Go to the OpenAPI interface  at [http://localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs)  

This will show the FastAPI-generated OpenAPI interface.

First the requests

then see the schemas

## Finally, go to the homepage [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
