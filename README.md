# Developing a Single Page App with FastAPI and Vue.js and Vuetify

Adapted from Michael Herman's article [Developing a Single Page App with FastAPI and Vue.js](https://testdriven.io/blog/developing-a-single-page-app-with-fastapi-and-vuejs/)
last updated December 14th, 2022, with github repo [https://github.com/testdrivenio/fastapi-vue](https://github.com/testdrivenio/fastapi-vue).

Pay particular attention to the graphical OpenAPI interface, which is auto-generated by **FastAPI**!
<br/>
<br/>
I simply added validation rules, and a confirm password field, to the existing registration page.  
Here's a snapshot:

# Using docker-compose for the build  
Make sure Docker is running locally.  
<br/>
Then use the images and spin up the containers:  
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```
<br/>
Apply the database migration for Tortoise ORM on PostgreSQL using aerich:

```sh
$ docker-compose exec backend aerich upgrade
```
<br/>

Open browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to verify that FastAPI service is running

This should show "FastAPI service is running"

<br/>
<br/>

Go to the OpenAPI interface  at [http://localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs)  

This will show the FastAPI-generated OpenAPI interface, first the requests

<br/>
<br/>
and then the schemas.

<br/>
<br/>

Finally, go to the homepage [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  to register or login
