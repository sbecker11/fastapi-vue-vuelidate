Registration page changes:

remove Full name field

set field border to red if it has any unmet rules

on touch, show only unmet rules with red x-mark

if any rule is satisfied while editing, change its red x-mark to a green check-mark

on blur, keep only unmet rules, hide all met rules


Username behavior and validation rules:

At least 3 chars required

when field has not been touched - show no validation error
once field is touched, if any rule is not met, set field border to red and show all unmet rules with red x-mark
while field has focus, hide all rules and set border to default color as soon as all rules are met
when field loses focus, any unmet rules remain visible and border remains red
submit button is disabled if any fields are invalid, that is, has a red border.

whitespace tooltip: "ignoring white spaces"
field border is red and tooltip shown for a max of 3 seconds when any white spaces are detected
